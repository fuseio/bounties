# Bounties

Our bounty program encourages community participation in the development of the Fuse ecosystem.

## Introduction

Anyone can initiate a bounty in this repository, offering token rewards to those who successfully complete the specified tasks.

Each bounty should clearly define its goal, requirements, acceptance criteria, and token rewards.

All bounties will be listed in the [Issues](https://github.com/fuseio/bounties/issues) tab.

## How to Participate

You can participate by either submitting a bounty specification as a new issue or by completing an existing bounty.

Bounty hunters should contact the bounty creator directly or comment on the issue to engage.

Clearly defined acceptance criteria will help both creators and hunters successfully complete the bounties.

## Rewards

Rewards are specified independently for each bounty.

## Examples

Potential bounties can vary in size and scope, including both technical and non-technical projects.
